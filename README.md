* This is a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MediFlowR_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `MediFlowR` because it tracks patient records for medical professionals.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[MediFlowR Product Website](docs/index.md)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
